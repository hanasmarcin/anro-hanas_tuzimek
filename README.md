# anro-hanas_tuzimek
Project made in the Anatomy of Robots classes, using ROS and Python.
The tasks were to:
- _Lab1_ - create ROS node to control the turtle;
- _Lab2_ - create the **URDF file with robot's model** for given variables and visualize it in RVIZ with a capability to move it's joints;
- _Lab3_ - create ROS nodes to solve the **forward kinematics task** with and without the **KDL** library;
- _Lab4_ - create ROS nodes to **interpolate the trajectory in the configuration space** and to generate, using interpolation, pose of created robot in the cartesian space;
- _Lab5_ - create ROS nodes to solve the **inverse kinematics task** of created robot.

Launch files were created and every component was then visualised in RVIZ.
